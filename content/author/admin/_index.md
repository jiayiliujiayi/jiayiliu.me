Atypical med student.  
INFJ.  
An OCD patient with obsessive compulsory personality.  
A perfectionist and pessimist.  
A big fan of all the absolute numbers.  
The languages that I speak: R, python, LaTex; Mandarin Chinese, Shanghainese dialect (a variety of the Wu Chinese), English.  
Crazy about anything that is logical, explicit, responsive and orderly.  

非典型医学生。  
强迫症患者，强迫型人格，追求完美，时常悲观。  
R \& python…… LaTex死忠粉。我爱质数。  
热爱一切逻辑清晰、简洁明了、有求必应和井井有条。  
最欣赏的诗：“往者不可谏，来者犹可追。”  
Self Potrait：“不学无术，面目可憎”；心怀失望，永不放弃。
