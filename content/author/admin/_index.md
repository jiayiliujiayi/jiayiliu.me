INTJ.  
An OCD patient with obsessive compulsory personality.  
An introvert, perfectionist and pessimist.  
A big fan of the prime numbers.  
The languages that I speak: R, python, LaTeX; Mandarin Chinese, Shanghainese dialect (a variety of Wu Chinese), English.  
Crazy about anything that is logical, explicit, responsive and orderly.  
In Chinese, my name is written *刘嘉奕*. It‘s a derivation of the word *「嘉贻」* in the Thousand Character Classic (千字文): *「貽厥嘉猷」*, which means "a wonderful gift".
