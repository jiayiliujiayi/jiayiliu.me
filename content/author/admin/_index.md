Atypical med student.  
INFJ.  
100% "Obsessive Compulsory Personality". 97% Perfectionism. 77% Pessimism.  
The languages that I speak: Mandarin Chinese, Shanghainese dialect, English; R, python.  
Big fan of LaTex. Innate personal preference for absolute numbers.  
Crazy about anything that is logical, explicit, responsive and orderly.  

非典型医学生。  
如假包换强迫型人格，追求完美，时常悲观。  
R \& python…… LaTex死忠粉。我爱质数。  
热爱一切逻辑清晰、简洁明了、有求必应和井井有条。  
最欣赏的诗：“往者不可谏，来者犹可追。”  
Self Potrait：“不学无术，面目可憎”；心怀希望，永不放弃。
