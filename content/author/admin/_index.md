Atypical med student. Majoring in Pediatrics (love kids!!!).   
100% "Obsessive compulsory personality". 97% Perfectionism. 77% Pessimism.  
Proficient in R; learning Python. Big fan of LaTex. Innate personal preference for absolute numbers.  
Crazy about anything that is logical, explicit, responsive and orderly.  

非典型医学生。学儿科，大部分源于喜欢小孩儿。  
如假包换强迫型人格，追求完美，时常悲观。  
平时常用R；python学习中…LaTex死忠粉。天生偏好质数。  
热爱一切逻辑清晰、简洁明了、有求必应和秩序井然。  
最欣赏的诗：“往者不可谏，来者犹可追。”  
自我评价：“不学无术，面目可憎”；心怀希望，永不放弃。
